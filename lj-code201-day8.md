<h1>Learning Journal 201 - Day 8</h1>
the last three days we worked on our salmon cookie shop website.
we learned about domain modeling which is the process of essentially storyboarding
a programs features, their attributes and how they work.
We also learned how to append html elements to a website, which is essentially
creating an entire functioning website out of js aside from the bare-bones
scaffolding. We've been working on html forms and js constructors as well to build
out our interactable website.
