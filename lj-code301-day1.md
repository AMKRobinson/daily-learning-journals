<h1>Learning Journal 301 - Day 1</h1>

Today we went over "mobile first" design which is essentially programming something
with the mobile viewport and functionality in mind first.

We also went over our reading for adaptive vs. responsive web design. The two are
similar in concept. Responsive is how a web site can respond quickly to different viewports where as adaptive design is the idea that you have different layouts for different viewports.

I'm excited and quite anxious to dig into the 301 material. Hopefully I don't become overwhelmed too
quickly, but I'm sure that's wishful thinking.
