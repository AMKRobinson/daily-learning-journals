<h1>Learning Journal 301 - Day 6</h1>

Today we learned how to set up a json file and access it with an ajax call using jquery.
This replaces our javascript objects file which stored our projects data.

I'm excited to get started working with server calls and manipulating the data on one.
Not so excited to see local storage mentioned again after 201.
