<h1>Learning Journal 301 - Day 8</h1>

We learned client server architecture, the flow of information when interacting with a server.
We went through the steps of initializing our projects with npm for nodejs and how to install
packages and setting them as dependencies.

I'm finding working with a sever really interesting, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.
