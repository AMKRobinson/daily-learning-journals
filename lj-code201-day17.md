<h1>Learning Journal 201 - Day 17</h1>
Today I implemented local storage in our project. Initially I was overwhelmed
and I spent a good amount of time theorizing how to do it. Low and behold the
solution was simpler than I thought. This came quicker than previous code problems
I had, so it was nice to see progress and very satisfying to get it working.
