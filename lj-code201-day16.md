<h1>Learning Journal 201 - Day 16</h1>
Today we put our github skills to the test. We had minimal merge conflicts
but the entire time we knew why we would have them before we even attempted to merge.
When reaching issues with my code I found myself looking back to my old projects
which would most of the time give me solutions or at least point me in the right direction.
That and stack overflow has been really helpful. I was able to find a way to
make google charts link to other pages which felt satisfying as there was nothing
on that in googles documentation.
